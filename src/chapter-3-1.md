Retrieval-based chatbots are virtual assistants that use predefined responses to answer customer queries. These chatbots can handle a wide range of queries and provide accurate responses based on predefined scripts. However, they may not be able to generate contextually relevant responses or learn from customer interactions.

Retrieval-based chatbots are typically used for tasks such as providing property information or answering questions about specific services.

Generative Chatbots
-------------------

Generative chatbots are virtual assistants that use machine learning algorithms to generate contextually relevant responses to customer queries. These chatbots can learn from customer interactions and adjust their responses accordingly, providing a personalized experience for customers. However, generative chatbots require significant training data sets and may struggle to handle complex queries.

Generative chatbots are typically used for tasks such as providing personalized recommendations or answering complex queries about properties or services.

Hybrid Chatbots
---------------

Hybrid chatbots combine rule-based, retrieval-based, and generative approaches to provide comprehensive assistance to customers. These chatbots can handle simple queries using predefined rules, provide accurate responses to specific queries using predefined scripts, and generate contextually relevant responses to complex queries using machine learning algorithms.

Hybrid chatbots are typically used for tasks such as providing personalized recommendations, answering complex queries, or scheduling property viewings.

AI Solutions in Real Estate
