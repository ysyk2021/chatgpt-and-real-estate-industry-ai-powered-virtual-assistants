Chapter 3: Introduction to ChatGPT
==================================

What is ChatGPT?
----------------

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the Transformer architecture and was trained on a massive corpus of text data using unsupervised learning techniques.

The "GPT" in ChatGPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer." The model was pre-trained on a large dataset of text data using self-supervised learning techniques. This involves training the model to predict missing words in a sentence or generate the next word given the previous words.

The pre-training of the model enables it to understand the nuances of human language and generate contextually appropriate responses. The model has been trained on a diverse range of text data, including books, websites, and social media platforms.
