Chapter: Limitations and Challenges of Virtual Assistants in Real Estate
========================================================================

Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we will discuss the limitations and challenges associated with virtual assistants powered by ChatGPT in the real estate industry. While these AI-powered assistants offer numerous benefits, it is important to understand the potential drawbacks and address the challenges to ensure their effective implementation and user satisfaction.

1. Contextual Understanding and Misinterpretation
-------------------------------------------------

Virtual assistants may face challenges in accurately understanding the context of user queries. While ChatGPT performs well in language understanding, it may occasionally misinterpret complex or ambiguous queries. This can result in inaccurate responses or failure to provide the desired information. Ensuring robust natural language processing techniques, such as intent recognition and context tracking, can mitigate this challenge.
